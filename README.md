# HexChat - Dark Mode
My semi customized HexChat theme. Using the [Re-Crono](https://github.com/xPaw/Re-Crono-HexChat) borders by [xPaw](https://github.com/xPaw/), and [lassekonge83](https://www.deviantart.com/lassekongo83)

### How to install

1 Download the .zip and place the re-crono folder into your HexChat themes folder. Located default in ```C:\Program Files\HexChat\share\themes```. This replaces the default white borders with a dark one.

2 Place the `colors.conf` file in ```C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Roaming/HexChat```. This replaces the default HexChat colours with the ones in the image.

Can be a mess with users joining left and right, but *hey* you can customize everything with this client.
